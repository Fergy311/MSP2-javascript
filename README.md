# Javascript Memory game 
## Milestone project 2 - interactive frontend Development 

* This site will be home to a flash card memory game, with a grid of cards you need to match up to complete the game.

* This will be my submission for Codes institute's Milestone Project two in my web applictation development course, showcaseing my Javascript delvelopment.

# User Experience

### Prospective users

* These are users who may use the website when bored, looking to get a gauge on someones abilitiy to memorise and match up icons

    * #### medical memory tests  
      Using flashcards to study medicine can be an effective method for many students. Flashcards can help with memorization, understanding complex concepts, and reinforcing important information. However, it's important to use flashcards in conjunction with other study methods, such as reading textbooks, attending lectures, and participating in hands-on clinical experiences. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that the flashcards are accurate and up-to-date with the latest medical knowledge.

    * #### young child schools 
      Howard Gardner's multiple intelligence theory reminds teachers that there are many types of learners within any one class. Gardner's research indicates that teachers should aim to appeal to all the different learner types at some point during the course. It is particularly important to appeal to visual learners, as a very high proportion of learners have this type of intelligence. Flash cards can be bright and colourful and make a real impact on visual learners. Many of the activities outlined below will also appeal to kinaesthetic learners. As said in this article by [Teaching english.org](https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/professional-development/teachers/managing-resources/articles/using-flash-cards-young-learners)

    * #### Friendly compitition 
      Everyone loves a bit of compitition, especially between friends. As an avid fan of videogames I personnally know that highscores mean alot and who doesn't enjoy being at the top of a leaderboard as stated in an article called [the rise of Gamification in learning](https://elearning.company/blog/understanding-the-psychology-behind-leaderboard-design/#:~:text=But%20it%27s%20not%20just%20about,by%20comparing%20them%20to%20others.), "Understanding the psychology behind leaderboard design, therefore, is critical to their success and efficacy in spurring learner interest and motivation. A well-planned leaderboard can instigate a sense of achievement, encourage participation, foster a healthy competitive environment, and greatly enhance the overall learning experience."  

## Design

### colour scheme 

<h2 align="center"><img src=assests/ReadMe/colourscheme.png></h2>

- Asimple colour scheme has been used. The websites has the same aesthetic as old webbased flash game webistes with the bold shades of the same base colour.

- the cards and the background box for the cards are lighter shades of green distinguishing them from from the darker background colour.

- I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/5b5b5b-7d7c7a-c9c19f-edf7d2) to decide and find the correct hexcode for the shades used. 

 ### typography

- I used Times New Roman, the fonts for the text on the site. 

- i chose Times New Roman because of the bold definition and clear message i carries

 ### imagary 

- I used emojis from the windows emoji keybord just for ease of access aswell as accessibility, because they are recognisable to people of all ages.

# Wireframes

<h2 align ="center"><imf src=assets/ReadMe/Wireframe.png></h2>


### Structure

- using HTML for general website layout 

- Using CSS for style, colours, fonts, alignments and sizing.

-used java withing the HTML page to make animations and rules for a win and loss

## Future Features

- score counter

- leaderbord showcasing highscores like old school arcade machines

- expanding grids with more pairs to match up 

# Technologies Used

  # Deployment

## GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using these steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Fergy311/course-reposi)
2. Locate the Navbar at the top of the Repository (not top of page). Click the Settings tab.
3. Locate the Navbar on the left hand side of the page. Click the "Pages" section (under 'Code and automation').
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "main". Click save.
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. A notification will appear at the top of the page with the [link](https://fergy311.github.io/course-reposi/) to the deployed site. You can return to this GitHub Pages section to access the link.

## Forking the GitHub Repository

Forks are used to propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. By forking the GitHub Repository you make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository.

To Fork a Github Repository:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Isabella-Mitchell/milestone-project-one)
2. Locate the Fork button in the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

You will now have a fork of the repository, but you don't have the files in that repository locally on your computer.

To make a local clone:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Isabella-Mitchell/milestone-project-one)
2. Above the list of files, click  Code.
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", click the 'Copy' icon. To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click Use SSH, then click the 'Copy' icon. To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click Use GitHub CLI, then click the 'Copy' icon.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub AE username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `milestone-project-one`...
